The gRPC library is one of the standard library modules of the<a target="_blank" href="https://ballerina.io/"> Ballerina</a> language.

This provides support for the gRPC messaging protocol. gRPC is an inter-process communication technology that allows you to connect, invoke and operate distributed heterogeneous applications as easily as making a local function call. The gRPC protocol is layered over HTTP/2 and It uses Protocol Buffers for marshaling/unmarshaling messages. This makes gRPC, highly efficient on wire and a simple service definition framework.

This Library supports below messaging patterns. For more information on the operations supported, go to [The gRPC Module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/grpc/).

- Simple RPC (Unary RPC)
- Server streaming RPC
- Client streaming RPC
- Bidirectional Streaming RPC

For example demonstrations of the usage, go to [Ballerina By Examples](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/by-example).

## Issues and Projects

Issues and Projects tabs are disabled for this repository as this is part of the Ballerina Standard Library. To report bugs, request new features, start new discussions, view project boards, etc. please visit Ballerina Standard Library [parent repository](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library). 

This repository only contains the source code for the module.

## Building from the Source

### Setting Up the Prerequisites

* Download and install Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 11 (from one of the following locations).

   * [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

   * [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

        > **Note:** Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the path name of the directory into which you installed JDK.

### Building the Source

Execute the commands below to build from source.

1. To build the library:
        
        ./gradlew clean build

1. To run the integration tests:

        ./gradlew clean test

1. To build the module without the tests:

        ./gradlew clean build -x test

1. To debug the Ballerina implementation against the native implementation:
   ```
   ./gradlew clean build -Pdebug=<port>
   ./gradlew clean test -Pdebug=<port>
   ```
1. To debug the Ballerina implementation against the Ballerina language:
   ```
   ./gradlew clean build -PbalJavaDebug=<port>
   ./gradlew clean test -PbalJavaDebug=<port>
   ```
