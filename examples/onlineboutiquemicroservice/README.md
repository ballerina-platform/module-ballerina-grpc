# Online Boutique Microservices Example

## Overview

Online Boutique Microservices example is based on the [cloud-native microservices demo application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) of [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform). 
The original example consists of 10 microservices implemented in various languages and 3 of those microservices are implemented in Ballerina here.
This example shows how Ballerina gRPC module can work effectively with microservices implemented in other languages.

Following shows an overview of the microservices.

| Service                                              | Language      | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [frontend](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/frontend)                           | Go            | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. Does not require signup/login and generates session IDs for all users automatically. |
| [cartservice](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/cartservice)                     | C#            | Stores the items in the user's shopping cart in Redis and retrieves it.                                                           |
| [productcatalogservice](./src/productcatalogservice) | Ballerina     | Provides the list of products from a JSON file and ability to search products and get individual products.                        |

| [shippingservice](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/shippingservice)             | Go            | Gives shipping cost estimates based on the shopping cart. Ships items to the given address (mock)                                 |
| [emailservice](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/emailservice)                   | Python        | Sends users an order confirmation email (mock).                                                                                   |
| [checkoutservice](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/checkoutservice)             | Go            | Retrieves user cart, prepares order and orchestrates the payment, shipping and the email notification.                            |
| [recommendationservice](./src/recommendationservice) | Ballerina     | Recommends other products based on what's given in the cart.                                                                      |
| [adservice](./src/adservice)                         | Ballerina     | Provides text ads based on given context words.                                                                                   |
| [loadgenerator](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/loadgenerator)                 | Python/Locust | Continuously sends requests imitating realistic user shopping flows to the frontend.                                              |

## Run the Example

### Prerequisites
#### Docker and Kubernetes
- Use [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) to install on Mac.
- Use [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) to install on Windows.
- Install [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/#server) and [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) on Linux.

**Note**: Execute `eval $(minikube docker-env)` after installing Minikube so
that the Docker client points to Minikubeâ€™s docker registry.

For this example to work, all the 10 microservices must be running. Therefore, you have to run the following services from [cloud-native microservices demo application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo).
* [Frontend](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/frontend)
* [Cart Service](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/cartservice)
* [Currency Service](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/currencyservice)
* [Payment Service](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/paymentservice)
* [Shipping Service](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/shippingservice)
* [Email Service](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/emailservice)
* [Checkout Service](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/checkoutservice)
* [Loadgenerator](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/master/src/loadgenerator)

1. Clone the [cloud-native microservices demo application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) of [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform) and continue to the repository directory.
2. The `kubernetes-manifests` file contains the deploying instructions for all the 10 services. Therefore, first remove the content related to the `adservice, recommendationservice` and `productcatalogservice`.
3. Run `kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml`to deploy the 7 services.
   
    Note: You can run `kubectl delete -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml` to stop the 7 services when in need.
4. Now clone this repository and run `sh examples/onlineboutiquemicroservice/scripts/start.sh`(This will build the 3 services and deploy in kubernetes).
5. Run `kubectl get pods` to see whether pods are in a Ready state.
6. If all the pods are running, run `kubectl get service/frontend-external` to get the frontend-external ip.
7. Visit the application on your browser to confirm installation.
   
   Note: If you are on Minikube, get the hostname by executing `minikube ip`. e.g., <MINIKUBE_IP>:<FRONTEND_EXTERNAL_PORT>
8. Run `sh examples/onlineboutiquemicroservice/scripts/stop.sh` to stop the 3 services.

You can rewrite any of the above 7 services using Ballerina to replace the existing services and deploy on kubernetes.
